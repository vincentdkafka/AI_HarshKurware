# Main Pipeline

START

1. User Input
   - Prompt: "Enter concept"  (currently it is hard coded)


2. Load Knowledge Graph
   - Read data/knowledge_graph_sample.json
   - Parse JSON into Graph object using NetworkX
   - If graph loading fails, show error and STOP

3. Retrieve Related Concepts
   - Query the graph to get subgraph of concept_name
   - If concept_name not found in graph, show message and STOP

4. Generate Slides and Script (AI Module)
   - Input: concept_name, related subgraph
   - AI generates:
       - Slide titles
       - Bullet points
       - Narration script
   - For MVP: use sample_script.json as mock output

5. Format Slides & Script
   - Input: AI output (slides & narration)
   - Format into Manim-friendly JSON/dict
   - Ensure each slide has:
       - title
       - content
       - optional diagram data

6. Animate Slides using Manim
   - For each slide in formatted slides:
       - Create scene
       - Add title, bullet points, diagrams
       - Apply animations and transitions
   - Combine all slides into final video
   - Save video to output/sample_video.mp4

7. Store & Display Output
   - Save video
   - Optional: save screenshots of slides in output/screenshots/
   - Notify user: "Video ready at output/sample_video.mp4"

# Notes
- All modules are orchestrated from pipeline.py
- The pseudo-code represents the execution flow, not exact Python code
- Future expansions may include:
    - Real-time AI generation
    - Voiceover / TTS
    - Multi-language support
    - Interactive domain-specific modules (GIS, Space Tech, CS)
